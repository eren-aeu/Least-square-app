This is a project done in the course "Computer-assisted math." [https://matematiflo.github.io/SoSe_2024/CompAssistedMath2024] in the University of Heidelberg.

Project is written in SageMath. It takes the data points of wanted size and degree of approximation you want to make nad draws the wanted polynomial.
At the last step, it compares the approximating polynomial with the Lagrange polynomial.
